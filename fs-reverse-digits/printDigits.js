//Write a function called printDigits 
//that takes in one argument, num. 
//When given an integer, the function should print (console.log) each digit in reverse order, starting with the ones place. 
//Do not do this by just turning the number into a string and reversing it. 
//Solve the problem using math. (Hint: look up while loops, and donâ€™t forget about the % operator.)

// For example, if you were given 1 you should simply print 1, if given 314 you should print 4, 1, 3, and if given 12 you should print 2, 1:



function printDigits (num) {
    let reverse = 0;
    let lastDigit;
    
    while(num != 0) {
        lastDigit = num % 10;
        reverse = reverse * 10 + lastDigit;
        num = Math.floor(num/10);
    } 
    console.log(reverse)
 
}
