1. Check if the POST request accepts params, queries, and/or a body. Which one(s) and what information is it expecting to be sent?
The POST request accepts body(�text�) the information expected is to write a text in the body.


2. What data type does the GET request return?
It returns an array of all posts.


3. What would the URL look like for deleting the post with the id 555? (This post does not exist anymore, but the syntax is the same for existing posts)
It will give an error.


4. List the possible response codes from the GET request at /posts/filter.
409 Conflict. The request query is missing the required text property.


5. Create a post whose text is your name, record the URL and body here:
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts


6. What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your favorite color instead of your name?
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/?id=1066


7.  What is the URL to get posts that contain the text �blue�?
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts


8. Make a request to GET all the posts. What are the content type and charset of the response? (Hint: look on the Headers)
The response content type is application/JSON and the charset is an array of all posts. application/JSON; charset=utf-8
9. What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?
Request was missing req.query.id or req.body.text


10. What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?
Nothing happens. It looks like it doesn�t influence the body.
